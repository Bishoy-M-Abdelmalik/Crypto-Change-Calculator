# Crypto Change Calculator

## Overview
Crypto Change Calculator is a simple Java application that computes the change for a ticket purchase in a fun and unique way using cryptocurrency denominations. The ticket price is subtracted from a total of 7500 Cryptom, and the remaining change is broken down into:
- **Bitom** (denomination of 500 Cryptom)
- **Ditom** (denomination of 200 Cryptom)
- **Zitom** (denomination of 50 Cryptom)
- **Cryptom** (remaining balance)

## Features
- **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter the ticket price (in Cryptom).
- **Calculation Logic:** Computes the change based on the ticket price.
- **Denomination Breakdown:** Outputs the change in terms of Bitom, Ditom, Zitom, and Cryptom.
- **Console Application:** Simple and easy-to-run application using standard Java libraries.

## How to Run
1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure that Java is installed on your system.
